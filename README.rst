Channel Identification Machines Toolbox
=======================================

Package Description
-------------------

The Channel Identification Machines (CIMs) Toolbox provides a set of algorithms
for the functional identification of a channel in a system consisting of a
communication channel in cascade with an asynchronous sampler, as well as
step-by-step demonstrations of the accompanying source code. The channel
considered here is modeled as a multidimensional filter, while models of
asynchronous sampler are taken from neuroscience and communications and
includes integrate-and-fire (IAF) neurons, asynchronous delta-sigma modulators
(ASDM), and general oscillators in cascade with zero-crossing detectors.

Future releases of this package may be obtained from the Bionet
Group's online code repository [1]_.
