Channel Identification Machines Toolbox
=======================================

Package Description
-------------------

The Channel Identification Machines (CIMs) Toolbox provides a set of 
algorithms for the functional identification of spiking neural circuits, 
as well as a step-by-step demonstration of the accompanying source code.
The neural circuits considered here consist of a linear dendritic 
processing filter in cascade with a spiking neuron model.

The CIM algorithms identify the dendritic processing filter and reconstruct
its kernel with arbitrary precision.

Future releases of this package may be obtained from the Bionet
Group's online code repository [1]_.
